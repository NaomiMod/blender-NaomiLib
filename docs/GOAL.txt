As final goal and basic logic, it should perform these operations:

1) Read float at 0x64 (LE 4 bytes long), to obtain Mesh 1 lenght

2) Skip float at 0x68 (LE 4 bytes long, it's a game parameter)

3) Read float at 0x6C (LE 4 bytes long) to know how many vertex the following chunk is composed by

4) **!Check!** From here starts good old vertex data coming in 2 flavours:

"Type A"  8 floats: X,Y,Z,Xn,Yn,Zn,U,V (LE 4 bytes long each)
"Type B"  2 floats: TypeB String ( XX XX FF 5F), pointer* (LE 4 bytes long)   *real offset is calculated as: Type B offset - (FFFFFFFF - pointer)

5) Upon reaching the end of mesh 1 lenght, it's either done or follows another mesh by skipping 0x4C bytes to find yourself just at new mesh lenght.
